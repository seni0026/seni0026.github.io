            <!-- Write at least two paragraphs about yourself. Minimum 50 words per paragraph -->
            <p>I recently left my home country, Jamaica, to study Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College as an International Student in Ottawa, ON. It has been very cold since i have arrived <br>here in Ottawa with temperature ranging from 35<sup>o</sup>F to -9<sup>o</sup>F. I am enjoying the winter season here in Ottawa. Seeing snow for the first was a wonderful experience for me mainly because i have never experience it before.</p>  
            <p>The program that i am enrolled in, Interactive Media Design, is a two (2) years diploma program. I chose this program because of my passion for digital graphics. Also, i was a part-time Graphic Designer in my home country. My dream is to be a Brand Identity Designer and own a disign studio one day.  </p>
