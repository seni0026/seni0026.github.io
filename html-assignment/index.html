            <!-- Write at least two paragraphs about yourself. Minimum 50 words per paragraph -->
            <p>My name is Kevon Senior. I recently left my home country, Jamaica, to study Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College as an International Student in Ottawa, ON. It has been very cold since i have arrived <br>here in Ottawa with temperature ranging from 35<sup>o</sup>F to -9<sup>o</sup>F. The sun seldomly shines. It is mostly overcast with rain, hail or snow falling. I am enjoying the winter season here in Ottawa. Seeing snow for the first <br>time was a wonderful experience for me mainly because i have never experience it before. I have yet to try out any of the winter activities such as ice skating, hockey, skiing, etc... I know i would enjoy them because <br> i am an adventurous person. I like trying new things, meeting different people and experiencing different cultures.</p>  
            <p>The program that i am enrolled in, Interactive Media Design, is a two (2) years diploma program. I chose this program because of my passion for digital graphics and all the other courses <br> it entails, such as; website development, photography, motion graphics, ui/ux design, etc.... Also, i was a part-time Graphic Designer in my home country. My dream is to be a Brand Identity <br> Designer and own a disign studio one day. So far, the program has been very interesting for me and i have no regrets comning to Algonquin College. This is <em>my favorite quote</em> that i constantly <br> remind myself of. It keeps me motivated to chase after my dreams and never give up;</p>
